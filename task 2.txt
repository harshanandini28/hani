Task 2

1. From task 1 we have created

	i) VPC network
	ii)firewall rule

2. To create an instance template 

	i)  which defines the machine type, boot disk and other instace properties.
	ii) it is a resource that we can use to create VM instance and MIG.

3. To create Managed Instance Group (MIG)

	i)  to configure zones and regions
	ii) under a instance template category specify instance template name for establishing connection
	    between instance template and MIG.
	iii)specify the min and max no of instances as 3 to 6.

4. Simulte scale in and out

	i) Initally it will create 3 MIG as we specified min no of instances as 3.
	ii)we can perform autoscaling on high availability of instances upto max 6 and min 3.

5. To reserve a static address inorder to provide the load balancer with a single point of entry.
   	i) reserve withipv4 and type as global.

6. Create load balancer

	i) specify front end and backend configuration
	iii) backend configuration is to define how load balancing want to distribute traffic.
	iii)front-end configuration is a server uses a virtual IP address to accepts requests.
	iv) set up health criteria to check the application in a regualr period of time.
	v)  if any of the application VM is not healthy then it recreates the VM.
7. get the external IP from frontend of loadbalancer by:
 	gcloud compute forwarding-rules | grep harsha-ipv4-frontend.

8. To create a local bash variable

	export LOAD_BALANCER_IP=[our_external_ip]

9. To monitor which zone the load balancer is directing traffic 

 	while true
do
        BODY=$(curl -s "$LOAD_BALANCER_IP")
        NAME=$(echo -n "$BODY" | grep "harsha-web-app-group" | perl -pe 's/.+?harsha-web-app-group-(.+?)<.+/\1/')
        ZONE=$(echo -n "$BODY" | grep "us-" | perl -pe 's/.+?(us-.+?)<.+/\1/')

        echo $ZONE
done

10. Create a local bash variable for which zone u want to disable

	export DISABLE_ZONE=us-central-f

11. we can examine the disablement of the us-central-f zone.

12. we can enable the same zone by 

	export ENABLE_ZONE=us-cemtral-f
